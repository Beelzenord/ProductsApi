This solution implements a  layered architecture consisting of API Gateways with Application  Services. The API behaves as if it was a component of a distributed system which is why every API call performs two calls to retrieve JSON data (attributes and products) instead of loading the data directly during runtime. I implemented strategy design which resolves how attributes are mapped on the output product list. Strategy design was also used to resolve the mapping of categories.I also used it to build some fault tolerance, for example attributes mentioned on the products that are unknown to the attribute meta will be filtered out and mentioned as a warning on the output meta file. The software is more strict towards the attribute meta, it wonâ€™t tolerate malformed property structure or duplicates.
